                	<h2>Saving paper and going mobile</h2>
                    <p>Annual reports can be pretty heavy&mdash;literally. Past annual reports from the College of Dentistry ran several pages long and were printed and mailed out to alumni and other stakeholders. To conserve both paper and postage, we opted to move the majority of the 2011-2012 annual report's data online.</p>
					<p>Many people still like to have something they can hold in their hands, so I designed an abbreviated mailer to offer an at-a-glance view of some of the college's pertinent numbers. However, the full annual report is only available online. I designed it using a responsive HTML and CSS framework for an adaptive yet consistent look and feel across different devices from desktop computers to tablets to mobile phones. Site visitors are able to print out the data as well as view it online.</p>

                    <p>Apollo, the WordPress theme in use for most UF Academic Health Center websites, provides either basic dropdown or extended "megamenu" navigation. But what if you want to use both on the same website? Or embed widgets and images in your megamenu? Or control the number of columns?</p>
					<p>The "&Uuml;bermenu" plugin allows for all that and more. Out of the box, the menu is rather bare-bones, so I gave the plugin a style makeover, overhauling its CSS to make it fit with the look and feel of the AHC websites and play nice with its code.</p>

                    <p>The College of Dentistry is gearing up for the 2015 site visit from the Commission on Dental Accreditation, which approves predoctoral dental education programs. At the same time, the college is revising its D.M.D. program curriculum. As part of those processes, I was tasked with creating branding and a website to host accreditation information, relevant documents, and a form to collect feedback from faculty members.</p>
					<p>Accreditation is a long and complex journey, so I designed the graphics with the style of vintage travel posters. The "Up!" campaign theme (inspired by the Pixar film) and the bunched balloons convey the sense that everyone must work together to lift the college to the next level.</p>

                     <h2>They say that "design by committee" is a bad thing.</h2>
                    <p>In 2010, the University of Florida Health Science Center and Shands teaching hospital began to build a new, patient-centric web presence for UF&amp;Shands. They wanted to include input from a variety of stakeholders&mdash;so design by committee it was. Things could've gotten ugly. Instead, we got together and designed a theme so impressive that the University Relations office adopted a version of it for the main UF website.</p>
                    <p>I served actively on the committee responsible for the website's design and navigation structure. Our big challenge was to develop a WordPress theme that would represent the health system, its six colleges, and numerous departments and offices as a collaborative entity, while being flexible enough to work for websites of all sizes and scopes. We answered this challenge by incorporating a global header and footer on all UF&amp;Shands subsites. We also researched many navigation methods and pored through as much usability data as we could find. The final product takes advantage of WordPress's extensibility, offering several navigation and other customization options. My role on the committee consisted of creating design elements, providing feedback on others' designs and usability data, writing a design standards manual and advocating for the unique needs of the College of Dentistry.</p>
                    <p>Once the new theme was ready for use, I directed the migration of the College of Dentistry website and completed a large percentage of the work. I revamped the site's information architecture to be more intuitive and less "institution-centric," fit within the new design, and conform to updated web standards. I also redesigned many of the most-visited landing pages (such as the Office of Admissions) to be more inviting, and I helped to train departmental authors in the use of WordPress. The website was launched in June 2012.</p>

                    <p>"A Tradition of Excellence" is the theme for the College of Dentistry's annual reports. To convey a sense of history in the 2010-2011 report, I used black-and-white photography throughout; since excellence often stands out from its surroundings, I treated each image with splashes of color. The minimalist aesthetic and sans serif headlines create a modern feel that bolsters the college's image of being on the cutting edge of dental care, education and research, while the ample white space and right angles anchor the design in the realm of the classic. Annual reports are full of charts, tables and graphs, which can get a little dull&mdash;so I created visual interest by integrating many of the infographics into the photos.</p>

                    <p>The intranet design is still in use. It was designed to complement the external website while remaining visually distinct from it, and there are future plans to bring its look and feel more in line with the redesigned college website.</p>

                    <h2>These are the voyages of the Starship... Denterprise. </h2>
                    <p>In 2010, the College of Dentistry was getting ready to switch to AxiUm, a new, all-electronic clinic management system. We wanted to make sure all faculty, staff and students knew what was coming. Big changes can be difficult, so a little disarming humor was called for. Part of the sales pitch for the new software was that it was "light-years ahead of its competitors." In a flash of inspiration, we decided on a <em>Star Trek</em> theme for our awareness and training materials.</p>
                    <p>The first project was to write and film a mini-episode of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5LqWAztU3Y" target="_blank">our version of the show</a>&mdash;this one set on the Starship <em>Dent</em>erprise&mdash;to lay out some of the reasons for the switch and the problems the new software would fix. Since we were making our Dean dress up in an Uhuru-inspired minidress and go-go boots, we decided to turn up the cheesiness with the other elements of the campaign, too: I designed "comm badge" pins to pass out to everyone, as well as uniform scrubs and hats for the "Klingon commandos" who trained clinical staff to use AxiUm. I also created the graphics used in the video and a website section to house the training documents.</p>

                	<h2>A Giving Tree.</h2>
                    <p>There's a lot of giving that goes on at the College of Dentistry: faculty give of their knowledge to students; students give their time and care to patients; staff give their expertise to keep things running smoothly; alumni and friends give donations. So it's fitting that "giving" was the theme for the 2009&ndash;2010 College of Dentistry Annual Report. I used a photograph of an oak tree for the inside cover to evoke growth, Florida, and Shel Silverstein's <em>The Giving Tree</em>, and chose green as the dominant color for the report design. Lush photography of our students, patients and researchers in action were the main graphics, putting human faces on the financial data.</p>

                	<h2>Promoting a wave of change</h2>
                    <p>In 2008, the D.M.D. student clinics were switching over to a new way of doing things, the TEAM clinical model. Just about every aspect of clinical operations, from patient scheduling to student grading, was changing&mdash;and we all know that change is not always welcomed!</p>
                    <p>So not only did we need to make college faculty, staff and students aware of the coming shift, we also wanted to convey the sense that while the transition would be challenging at times, it was inevitable&mdash;and that it would ultimately benefit students and patients. The "wave" metaphor was a perfect theme to encourage stakeholders to paddle in the direction we wanted them to. I created a logo to help convey the message that the TEAM model was "Patient Centered, Student Friendly." I also developed a website area to house documents about the change and assisted with compiling weekly "Surf Reports" to keep people apprised of upcoming developments (in the process learning more surfing terminology than I'll ever use again).</p>
